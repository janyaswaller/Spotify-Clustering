# Spotify-Clustering
This is a Jupyternotebook explaining the steps to classify a dataset using KMeans and DBscan. 
It covers the exploration of the dataset, steps to decide on which clustering methods can be used and different ways of visualizing the solution.

The dataset I am using is "The Spotify Hit Predictor Dataset (1960-2019)" from Farooq Ansari. The dataset was accessed through kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theoverman/the-spotify-hit-predictor-dataset/discussion/131250.

This analysis was done for an university project. Part of the code was inspired/copied from code shown in the lessons.
